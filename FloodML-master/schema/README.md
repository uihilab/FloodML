# Flood Markup Language (FloodML) Schema

## Introduction
The idea of Flood Markup language (FloodML) materialized to standardize all the streamflow and flood related data and make it easier to share with others. As is stated in the recent reports, predesigned language may help to minimize the human error and improve the flood-related information access, preparedness, and response for both public and decision makers, and modeling studies for researchers.

FloodML data include the metadata such as issued organization, event time and waterbody locations. It also includes water data such as water stage and flow rate from both historical observations and model output predictions. Thus, the FloodML can be used to spread through both researchers and the public. In addition, FloodML includes flood alerts data, which can be issued automatically when the model outputs are higher than the flooding alert levels. Related instructions and follow up media broadcast can be released together with the alert as well. It is supported with multiple formats (xml, sql, json). Here is the schema:
