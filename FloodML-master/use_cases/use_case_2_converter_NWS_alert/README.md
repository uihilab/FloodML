# Use Case of NWS Alert

## Original File
The original National Weather Service provides the alert in the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) format as shown in NWS_Alert_20190103.xml

## Directed Converted File
It can be automatically converted using .php scripts into FloodML as shown in NWS_Alert_20190103_FloodML.xml with all the alert information.

## Preferred File
Once FloodML is adopted, a preferred file with all related data is shown in NWS_Alert_20190103_FloodML_Preferred.xml. This file shows the desired format with data from the NWS forecast service.
