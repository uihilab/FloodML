# Use Case of Multiple Forecasts Visualization

## Multiple Datasets in One File
The FloodML supports multiple forecasts datasets in one file. An example is provided three forecast datasets from National Weather Service, National Water Model, and artificial intelligence model in the Multi_forecasts_20191231_FloodML.xml

## Time-Series Plots of Multiple Datasets
Multiple datasets in one FloodML can be plotted by the javascripts directly. Here the example shows three forecast datasets from three organizations in dygraph.js.
You can custmize your own plots using our template in vis_multi_forecast_20191231.html
