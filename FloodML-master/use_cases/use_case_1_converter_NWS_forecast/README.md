# Use Case of NWS Forecast

## Original File
The original file obtained from the National Weathre Service is: NWS_RCKI2_20201019.xml

## Directed Converted File
It can be automatically converted using .php scripts into FloodML as shown in NWS_RCKI2_20201019_FloodML.xml with many missing values that NWS did not provides in their files.

## Preferred File
Once FloodML is adopted, a preferred file with all important information is shown in NWS_RCKI2_20201019_FloodML_Preferred.xml
