# Use Case of Alert Visualization

## Map Visualization of the Alert Area
Since the station information and aleat affected area are shown in FloodML, the alert can be visualized on map services directly. The example here shows the visualization of NWS_Alert_20190103_FloodML_Preferred.xml in use_case_2.

## Time-Series Plots of the Alert Data
Alert-related time-series data can be plotted by the javascripts directly. Here the example shows the alert-related data in dygraph.js.
Download the vis_map_withoutAPI.html file and custmize your own visualization map with your google map API key.
